                <h2>ECG Clinic</h2>
                <p>An ECG may be requested by a heart specialist (cardiologist) or any doctor who thinks you might have a problem with your heart, including your GP. The test can be carried out by a specially trained healthcare professional at a hospital, a clinic or at your GP surgery. Despite having a similar name, an ECG isn't the same as an echocardiogram, which is a scan of the heart.</p>
