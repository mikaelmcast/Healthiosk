                <h2>Diabetes Clinic</h2>
                <p>Clinic staff check how your diabetes is being managed, help you with any difficulties, and pre-empt any possible future health problems. They'll also help you learn how to look after your diabetes and anything else you might need to know about, like new technology. Although you know what your blood sugar test results are every day, if you're having a bad patch, it can be hard to figure out why on your own. Clinic staff will help you understand why this is happening and what your body is doing over a longer period of time. Make sure you ask your diabetes team if you don't understand anything such as new test results.</p>
